# Challenges and ideas

Within Argu, the Challenge and the Idea play an important role in the discussion structure. This structure is designed to facilitate nuanced, solution-oriented discussions.

## Challenge

A Challenge is an issue or problem that encourages people to think along, so they can submit ideas. [See DemoGemeente.nl for an example of a challenge](https://demogemeente.nl/q/649).

### Tips for challenges:

- Give **context about the challenge**, so people can share a useful idea more easily
- Indicate what is **possible** and what is not possible
- You can make [locations](locations.md) mandatory for ideas, thus showing them on the map
- Use a **deadline** to clarify when you will process the input
- Let it be known how the input will be **processed**, i.e. how the decision makers will view the input
- End the text with a **call to post an idea**
- Keep participants in the loop with [Updates](updates.md)

## Idea

An Idea is a proposal with a title and a description. Often ideas are listed under a Challenge. An idea can have [arguments for or against it](arguments.md). It can also be [voted on](voting.md). See [an example idea here](https://demogemeente.nl/m/4).
