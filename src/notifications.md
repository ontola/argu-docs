# Tracking and Notifications

You can "follow" almost any item on Argu. When you do so, you will receive notifications of new posts.

You can follow items at two levels:

- **All posts**: You will be notified of all new posts. Every time you post a message, you follow your own message on this level. So by default you'll get notifications when someone replies to your post.
- Important messages**: You will only receive a notification when an Update is posted. If you comment or vote on someone else's item, you follow the parent item on this level. This is useful, for example, if you are participating in a large discussion where you don't need to be notified of everything, but you do need to be notified when important news is shared.

Most of this happens automatically - you follow items you create yourself on a more intense level than items you respond to. You can always change the level of tracking later by clicking on the bell icon in the top right corner of an item.

## Viewing notifications

When you are logged in, a number will appear in the main menu next to your profile picture showing how many new notifications you have. By clicking on it, you can view them. You can mark notifications as 'read' by opening them, or by pressing the little red button.

## Email notifications

You can set when you want to receive emails from your notifications in user settings. You can choose how often you receive them (never, immediately, daily, weekly).
