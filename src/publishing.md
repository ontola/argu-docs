# Saving, publishing and concepts

Some of the items you create are first saved as Drafts. If something is a draft, it is only visible to administrators and the creator (you). You can find your drafts (your unpublished items) by going to your profile (click on avatar in the top menu bar) and going to "Drafts".

When you're ready to publish, click "Publish" in the map below your item. At this point, notifications will be sent to people who are following the item above.
