# Two-Factor Authentication

We support the possibility for Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). This means that when logging in, in addition to a password and e-mail address, you must also use a confirmation code from your telephone. This is an extra security measure that is particularly valuable for administrators to set up.

You can turn it on in user settings -&gt; authentication.

As administrator you can require each group to use 2FA. Do this in group settings.
