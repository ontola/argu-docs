# Change house style / theme

Argu includes tooling to greatly customise the look and feel of the platform.

## Basic theme settings

You can change the theme of your website by going to Menu -&gt; Settings as an administrator. You will find various settings at the bottom:

- The primary and secondary colours. These are used at various places in the interface
- The colour of the navigation bar (white / primary / secondary)
- Colour of titles (can follow the primary colour)

## NL Government house style

If your organisation is a Dutch (sub)government organisation that uses the national house style, we have a detailed template for this. This is a setting we can apply on request.

## Other changes

If you want to change more complex things (font, form, other), please [contact us](https://argu.co/argu/edges/contact).
