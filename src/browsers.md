# What browsers does Argu work in?

We always support the latest versions of:

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Apple Safari (MacOS, iOS)
- Microsoft Edge
- Brave

We also do our best to work within other browsers (such as Internet Explorer 11), but we do not officially support them. It is therefore possible that some functions will not work properly. We always display a warning in outdated browsers to make it clear to users that they need to install a modern browser to use the website properly.
