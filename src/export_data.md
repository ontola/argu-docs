# Exporting and archiving data

All [Items](https://argu.co/argu/t/10890) on Argu can be exported. This can be done per discussion, but also per forum. Do this by logging in as administrator, clicking on the 'three points' menu of an item and clicking 'export'. You can also add '/exports/new' to the URL. The export is then created. Depending on the number of items, this can take a few minutes. You will receive an e-mail when the export is ready to download.

The export contains the following formats:

* XLS (Excel)
* JSON
* JSON-LD
* N3
* N-Triples
* RDF/XML

Do you want to use live data? Then use [the API](https://argu.co/argu/t/10518).
