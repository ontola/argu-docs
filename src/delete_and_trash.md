# Hide and permanently delete

As an administrator, you can delete items belonging to others. There are two ways to do this:

## Hide

Hiding' means that an item will no longer be shown in overviews, but it can still be retrieved. We usually recommend this, as it is a very transparent and mild form of censorship. You can give a reason for hiding an item, which is visible to the poster and anyone viewing the hidden item later. So use Hide in most cases**, for example if a comment is **off-topic** or **inappropriate**.

## Permanently delete

Permanent Deletion erases the information from the servers. This is more invasive and can be seen as censorship. Please use this only if a comment contains **privacy sensitive information**, is **unwanted advertising** or **against the law**.
