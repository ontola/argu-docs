# Budgeting

Argu has a Budgeting / Budgetting tool that makes it possible to:

- **Collect suggestions**
- **Select** them (e.g. based on **number of votes**, approval by administrators or something else)
- Give the ideas / project proposals a certain **price in Euros**. This can be set by administrators.
- Provide people with **unique voting codes**. These can be distributed by post or digitally.
- Allowing people to vote by distributing a **budget**. Users get their own shopping basket with a certain budget, and can then add ideas until the budget is distributed.
