# No confirmation email received

If, after voting or registering, you do not receive a confirmation e-mail, there may be a few things wrong:

## The email is in your spam folder

You can open your mail now. Mark the email as 'not spam' to avoid this happening again later.

## You have already received a confirmation email (a long time ago).

Go to your profile, top right of the screen, then to 'notifications', there on 'confirm account' and press 'send again'. You will then receive a new link.

## There is a typo in your email address

The easiest way is to just create a new account with the correct email address. For example, if you have already voted or posted items, please contact support@argu.co, send the link to the item you were in and ask us to manually change your email address to the correct one.

## Your mail server has blocked the mail

Sometimes mails are not received because the mail server does not accept the message. If you think this is due to an error in our mails, please contact us. If necessary, try registering with a different e-mail address that has a different domain.

## Our mail server is not working properly

In this case, there is an error with sending on our side. Please contact support@argu.co, so we can work on it as soon as possible.
