# Arguments

What do you think Argu got its name from? That's right.

Under an idea, you can place arguments for and against it. These appear in separate columns (for left, against right), so that you can quickly see what the most important pros and cons of an idea are.

Arguments can be voted up using the _upvote_ button. The arguments with the most upvotes are shown at the top of the overview.

By default, an Argument is not listed by who posted it - this is to keep the focus on the _content_ of the discussion, and not on who posted it. If you open the argument, you can still see who posted it.
