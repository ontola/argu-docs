# Banners

Banners are bars that can be attached to the navigation bar. You can use them to share an important message with all your visitors, such as "This is a demo version", "This forum is closed" or "We have a temporary promotion!".

## Creating banners

You can create banners as an administrator under "menu -&gt; settings -&gt; banners". Here you can set the content of the banner (you can format the text). Also you can set who sees the banner:

- guests (people without an account),
- users (people with an account) or
- everyone.

## Button text

If you do want people to be able to close the banner, choose a button text like 'close' or 'agree'.
If you don't want anyone to be able to close the banner, leave the 'button text' blank.
