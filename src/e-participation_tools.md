# E-Participation tools - when to use which one?

Participation is often customised. Depending on your target group, the theme, the place and your own goals, a particular form of e-participation may be most appropriate. Our software is designed to handle a very wide range of participation needs. Whether you want a short survey, an in-depth discussion, a closed update or a question-answer structure: with Argu it is possible.

If you have created a [Forum](forums.md), you can choose one of the tools below in the "+" menu, to the right of "discussions" in the Forum.

## Topics

A Topic is the simplest tool: a **message with reactions**. You probably already know it from online forums. Use this only to **inform**, when the other tools don't fit well, or when you don't yet know exactly what kind of input you want.

## Ideas

An [Idea](challenges_and_ideas.md) is a **proposal** that can be voted on. Arguments for or against it can also be placed underneath - this is where the name Argu comes from. Post an Idea if you want to propose something concrete, measure support or have a yes/no question answered by a group.

## **Challenges**

A [Challenge](challenges_and_ideas.md) is a **question** or a problem that encourages people to think about it, so they can submit **ideas**. A Challenge also gives people a chance to say why they support or do not support certain options. Use a Challenge if you would like to harness the creativity of your target audience, or if you want to present multiple options.

## Surveys

The [Survey](surveys.md) is a **questionnaire** that is usually completed anonymously. Use this if you want to collect anonymous, quantifiable data, and prefer not to interact/discuss.

## Project

A [Project](projects.md) has a **timeline with phases**, and is especially useful if you want to engage a group of people in different ways over a long period of time. You can use a separate tool for each phase - for example, a survey for the first, a challenge for the second, and an update for the last.
