# Projects and stages

A Project is [one of the tools](e-participation_tools.md) that you can use on Argu. A Project has a timeline, which consists of Phases. Each Phase can show a different thing. Projects are useful for engaging people over time. For example, in the first phase you can inform people about a certain project (with a Blogpost), in a second phase you can get ideas (with a Challenge), in a third phase you can discuss internally, then give feedback (send an Update) and then execute.

## Creating a new Project

To create a Project, go to a forum, click on the plus icon under discussions and select 'new Project'.

## Creating phases

Below the track, you will see the stages as tabs. Press the plus icon to create a new phase.

By default, the phases "Survey", "Submit ideas" and "Feedback" are created. You can change these by clicking on "edit" in the menu.

## Completing phases

If you want to proceed to the next phase, click on "complete". This will start the next phase, and this new phase will be shown first to new visitors.
