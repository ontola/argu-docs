# Communities

In Argu, the Community is the largest and most important resource.
A Community is the space where people come together and discuss things.
Communities have their unique URL or even [custom domain name](domain.md).
They can be [themed](theme.md) to match your organization's brand.
Edit the [menu](menu.md) to shape how users navigate your Community.
You can create and manage [groups](groups.md) in communities and give them rights.
Set [banners](banners.md) to share important messages with all visitors.
Create [forums](forums.md) to have sub-spaces where people can discuss items.
