Argu is used to involve people in decision-making.
It is therefore extra important that everyone gets a chance to participate.
We therefore consider it important that the website is accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities that make web browsing difficult.

## Accessibility statement

For government websites it is mandatory to have an accessibility statement. That of Argu.co is [here to read](https://www.toegankelijkheidsverklaring.nl/verklaringen/445/preview
). It applies to all websites running on the Argu software.

## Web Guidelines / WCAG standard

The international standard for accessibility research is the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), a standard maintained by the W3C.
The stricter, modern version of this is the WCAG 2.1.
There are several levels of this: A, AA and AAA.
We try to meet the strictest requirements with our web application (which you use to view this page).
We have therefore carried out the following checks:

- We have done a [quick scan on WCAG.co.uk](https://wcag.nl/rapporten/dada75b412bc/), where we meet all the checks for the highest AAA guideline. The last check was done on 10 January 2020 for [a feature page for Argu discussion](https://argu.nl/m/79).
- We have worked out all the points from the WCAG 2.1 [specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). The last check was done on 26 June 2020. See below for results:

### WCAG 2.1 AA

- x] [1.1.1 - Non-text Content](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html). Images are provided with 'alt' tags where possible. Users may also add tags to images, but this is not mandatory.
- x] [1.2.1 - Audio-only and Video-only (Pre-recorded) ](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING). Not applicable, as the application does not support video and audio.
- x] [1.2.2 - Captions (Pre-recorded)](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html). Not applicable.
- x] [1.2.3 - Audio Description or Media Alternative (Pre-recorded)](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-audio-desc.html). Not applicable.
- x] [1.2.4 - Captions (Live)](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-real-time-captions.html). Not applicable.
- x] [1.2.5 - Audio Description (Pre-recorded)](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-audio-desc-only.html). Not applicable.
- X] [1.3.1 - Info and Relationships](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html). Argu uses logical, semantic HTML5 tags and uses Aria attributes to make semantic value clear to non-visual users. Forms have visual and non-visual indications to shade required fields.
- [x] [1.3.2 - Meaningful Sequence](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-sequence.html). Argu has a logical sequence of HTML elements that is consistent with what can be seen visually.
- X] [1.3.3 - Sensory Characteristics](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG21/content-structure-separation-understanding.html). The structure and actions of a page are clearly described in text, so that even visually impaired users can use the application.
- X] [1.3.4 - Orientation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/orientation.html). The structure and actions of a page are clearly described in text, so that visually impaired users can also use the application.
- X] [1.3.5 - Identify Input Purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html). We use semantic forms, where the computer can read out the meaning of a field.
- X] [1.4.1 - Use of Colour](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html). Colour is used to display information in forms, but we also use 'disabled' tags to disable elements so that the focus is not on them for visually impaired users.
- X] [1.4.2 - Audio Control](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-dis-audio.html). Not applicable.
- x] [1.4.3 - Contrast (Minimum)](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html). We keep high contrast values of 3:1 (large text) and 4.5:1 (small text) to keep readability as high as possible.
- x] [1.4.4 - Resize Text](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-scale.html). All content can be resized with in-browser font-size controls. The application is expressed in relative sizes, so that the interface remains usable even with large fonts. The content can be enlarged to more than 200% without losing functionality.
- x] [1.4.5 - Images of Text](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-text
