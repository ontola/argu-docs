Argu is used to involve people in decision-making.
It is therefore extra important that everyone gets a chance to participate.
We therefore consider it important that the website is accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities that make web browsing difficult.

## Accessibility statement

For government websites it is mandatory to have an accessibility statement. That of Argu.co is [here to read](https://www.toegankelijkheidsverklaring.nl/verklaringen/445/preview
). It applies to all websites running on the Argu software.

## Web Guidelines / WCAG standard

The international standard for accessibility research is the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), a standard maintained by the W3C.
The stricter, modern version of this is the WCAG 2.1.
There are several levels of this: A, AA and AAA.
We try to meet the strictest requirements with our web application (which you use to view this page).
We have therefore carried out the following checks:

- We have done a [quick scan on WCAG.co.uk](https://wcag.nl/rapporten/dada75b412bc/), where we meet all the checks for the highest AAA guideline. The last check was done on 10 January 2020 for [a feature page for Argu discussion](https://argu.nl/m/79).
- We have worked out all the points from the WCAG 2.1 [specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). The last check was done on 26 June 2020. See below for results:

### WCAG 2.1 AA

- [x] [1.1.1 - Non-text Content](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html). Images are provided with 'alt' tags where possible. Users may also add tags to images, but this is not mandatory.
- [x] [1.2.1 - Audio-only and Video-only (Pre-recorded) ](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING). Not applicable, as the application does not support video and audio.
- [x] [1.2.2 - Captions (Pre-recorded)](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-captions.html). Not applicable.
- [x] [1.2.3 - Audio Description or Media Alternative (Pre-recorded)](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-audio-desc.html). Not applicable.

- [x] [1.3.1 - Info and Relationships](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-programmatic.html). Argu uses logical, semantic HTML5 tags and uses Aria attributes to make semantic value clear to non-visual users. Forms have visual and non-visual indications to shade required fields.
- [x] [1.3.2 - Meaningful Sequence](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/content-structure-separation-sequence.html). Argu has a logical sequence of HTML elements that is consistent with what can be seen visually.
- [x] [1.3.3 - Sensory Characteristics](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG21/content-structure-separation-understanding.html). The structure and actions of a page are clearly described in text, so that even visually impaired users can use the application.
- [x] [1.3.4 - Orientation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/orientation.html). The structure and actions of a page are clearly described in text, so that visually impaired users can also use the application.
- [x] [1.3.5 - Identify Input Purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html). We use semantic forms, where the computer can read out the meaning of a field.
- [x] [1.4.1 - Use of Colour](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-without-color.html). Colour is used to display information in forms, but we also use 'disabled' tags to disable elements so that the focus is not on them for visually impaired users.
- [x] [1.4.2 - Audio Control](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-dis-audio.html). Not applicable.
- [x] [1.4.3 - Contrast (Minimum)](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html). We keep high contrast values of 3:1 (large text) and 4.5:1 (small text) to keep readability as high as possible.
- [x] [1.4.4 - Resize Text](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-scale.html). All content can be resized with in-browser font-size controls. The application is expressed in relative sizes, so that the interface remains usable even with large fonts. The content can be enlarged to more than 200% without losing functionality.
- [x] [1.4.5 - Images of Text](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-text-presentation.html). The application does not use images of text.

- [x] [1.4.11 - Non-Text contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html). We use a minimum of 3:1 contrast, also for icons.
- [x] [1.4.12 - Text spacing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/text-spacing.html). We use sufficient space between letters and lines.
- [x] [1.4.12 - Content on Hover or Focus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/content-on-hover-or-focus.html). Hover and focus interactions are optional and always easy to remove.
- [x] [2.1.1 - Keyboard](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-keyboard-operable.html). The application is easy to use with just the keyboard. You can handle the entire registration + post flow without a mouse.
- [x] [2.1.2 - No Keyboard Trap](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/keyboard-operation-trapping.html). There are no places in the application where the focus gets stuck and cannot be escaped. Modals can be closed with 'escape'.
- [x] [2.1.4 - Character Key Shortcuts](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/character-key-shortcuts.html). We don't use keyboard shortcuts that conflict with basic keys.
- [x] [2.2.1 - Timing Adjustable](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-required-behaviors.html). Not applicable - no time limits in the app.
- [x] [2.2.2 - Pause, Stop, Hide](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-pause.html). Not applicable - no automatically moving items.
- [x] [2.3.1 - Three Flashes or Below](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/seizure-does-not-violate.html). Not applicable - no flashing items.
- [x] [2.4.1 - Bypass Blocks](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-skip.html). We provide a 'skip to main' button after 2 tabs.
- [x] [2.4.2 - Page Titled](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-title.html). All pages have titles.
- [x] [2.4.3 - Focus Order](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-order.html). The focus order corresponds to a logical order, similar to the one on the screen.
- [x] [2.4.4 - Link Purpose (In Context)](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-refs.html). All application links have logical names and icons have an alt tag.
- [x] [2.4.5 - Multiple Ways](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-mult-loc.html). Pages are findable through clicking on links, through hierarchy (the breadcrumbs) and through the search functionality.
- [x] [2.4.6 - Headings and Labels](http://www..w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-descriptive.html). The application consistently uses semantically correct HTML5 tags, including headings in articles and labels in forms.
- [x] [2.4.7 - Focus Visible](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-focus-visible.html). The current focus is visible. The style is overwritten to make it look consistent.
- [x] [2.5.1 - Pointer Gestures](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-gestures.html). In almost all parts of the app, multiple fingers are not needed on touch screens, and as a fallback for map views, you can zoom with separate buttons.
- [x] [2.5.2 - Pointer Cancellation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/pointer-cancellation.html). Our buttons only perform their action when you release the button.
- [x] [2.5.3 - Label in Name](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/name-in-label.html). We always use textual labels, or icons with a name field.
- [x] [2.5.4 - Motion Actuation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/motion-actuation.html). We do not use motion controls.
- [x] [3.1.1 - Language of Page](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-doc-lang-id.html). We set a language of the page.
- [ ] [3.1.2 - Language of Parts](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-other-lang-id.html). We do not yet comply. Parts of texts with another language than the main language of the website (like the english beginning of this 3.1.2) cannot be marked as other language in this application. This is because the texts are written in the [MarkDown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/), and that does not support language metadata. This problem is only limited to parts of a single piece of text - individual items (such as two separate responses) could have their own language attribute with our technology. This is something we plan to introduce in the coming year.
- [x] [3.2.1 - On Focus](http://www.w
- [ ] [3.1.2 - Language of Parts](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-other-lang-id.html). We do not yet comply with this. Parts of texts with another language than the main language of the website (like the English beginning of this 3.1.2) cannot be marked as other language in this application. This is because the texts are written in the [MarkDown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/), and that does not support language metadata. This problem is only limited to parts of a single piece of text - individual items (such as two separate responses) could have their own language attribute with our technology. This is something we plan to introduce in the coming year.
- [x] [3.2.1 - On Focus](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-receive-focus.html). Changing focus never triggers actions.
- [x] [3.2.2 - On Input](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-unpredictable-change.html). Forms use semantically correct buttons and trigger onSubmit.
- [x] [3.2.3 - Consistent Navigation](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-locations.html). The navigation bar with the menu is always the same within the Application.
- [x] [3.2.4 - Consistent Identification](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/consistent-behavior-consistent-functionality.html). The application has very consistent use of iconography and text to indicate functionalities.
- [x] [3.3.1 - Error Identification](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/minimize-error-identified.html). Errors in forms are noted directly, inline, with a textual explanation.
- [x] [3.3.2 - Labels or Instructions](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/minimize-error-cues.html). Forms contain tips on input of components.
- [x] [3.3.3 - Error Suggestion](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/minimize-error-suggestions.html). Forms contain tips on correct entries in case of incorrect entries.
- [x] [3.3.4 - Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data)](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/minimize-error-reversible.html). To reverse unintended actions, users can always permanently delete previously posted content. In addition, when important content is posted, where people receive a notification, a separate "publish" action is required in addition to a "save" action.
- [x] [4.1.1 - Parsing](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-parses.html). The generated HTML content is automatically checked for validity.
- [x] [4.1.2 - Name, Role, Value](http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/ensure-compat-rsv.html). We use existing HTML components and A11Y tested react form components.

### WCAG 2.1 AAA

The even stricter standard is the AAA ranking. Here is a list:

- [x] [1.2.6 - Sign Language (Pre-recorded)](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-sign.html).  Not applicable.
- [x] 1.2.7 - Extended Audio description (Pre-recorded). Not applicable.
- [x] 1.2.8 - Media Alternative (Pre-recorded). Not applicable.
- [x] 1.2.9 - Audio Only (Live). Not applicable.
- [x] [1.3.6 - Identify Purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html). We use aria tags to clarify the functions of buttons etc. for screen readers.
- [ ] 1.4.6 - Contrast (Enhanced). Our contrast values are 4.5:1, not 7:0. We do not comply with this. The reason for this is that high contrast values require a lot of attention and look restless. Some items, such as the date a message was posted, are therefore shown in lower contrast. However, these are often not essential components - the items for participation (such as placing a comment / logging in) do comply with the 7:0 ratio.
- [x] 1.4.7 - Low or No Background Audio. Not applicable.
- [ ] 1.4.8 - Visual Presentation Offer users a range of presentation options. Not yet implemented.
- [x] 1.4.9 - Images of Text (No Exception). We do not use images with text in them - unless users post them themselves.
- [ ] 2.1.3 - Keyboard (No Exception). Almost everything can be done with the keyboard, but some things can't be done yet - like choosing a location on the map.
- [x] 2.2.3 - No Timing. There are no time limits on the website.
- [x] 2.2.4 - Interruptions.	Users are never interrupted.
- [x] 2.2.5 - Re-authenticating. Filled in forms are remembered by the application, even after logging in.
- [x] [2.2.6 - Timeouts](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/timeouts.html). We keep data in unsaved forms until the user manually deletes the local storage.
- [x] 2.3.2 - Three Flashes. The application has no flashes.
- [x] [2.3.3 - Animations from Interactions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/animation-from-interactions.html). We do not use animations at the moment.
- [x] 2.4.8 - Location. We use breadcrumbs to indicate the location of a user.
- [x] 2.4.9 - Link Purpose (Link Only). Links always have useful, contextual text.
- [x] 2.4.10 - Section Headings. Pages of Argu itself always have headings to break up text.
- [ ] [2.5.5 - Target Size](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/target-size.html). We use large buttons for important buttons (like login / submit) that comply with the standard, but advanced functionality can be smaller than 44px. It is also possible to increase the font-size in the browser, which will make the buttons large enough.
- [x] [2.5.5 - Concurrent Input Mechanisms](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/concurrent-input-mechanisms.html). It is quite possible to use multiple input device types interchangeably.
- [x] 3.1.3 - Unusual words. In our own documentation we try to explain or link to difficult words.
- [x] 3.1.4 - Abbreviations. We also try to explain abbreviations.
- [x] 3.1.5 - Reading Level. We actively do our best to have our own content as readable as possible - for any reading level.
- [ ] 3.1.6 - Pronunciation. We do not explain pronunciation of words.
- [x] 3.2.5 - Change on Request. Items change only when users request them. For example, forms are not automatically submitted, and there are no automatically scrolling items on the screen. However, this may change in the future, as we want to make it possible for changes to be processed directly on the screen. We still need to find a convenient way to ensure accessibility.
- [x] 3.3.5 - Help. We add explanatory texts to forms, and provide a help desk (which you are now viewing).
- [x] 3.3.6 - Error Prevention (All). For each error in a form, we provide textual feedback where the error is.
- [x] [4.1.3 - Status Messages](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/status-messages.html). Pop-up messages (e.g. after login / error message / posting) comply with aria guidelines.

## User content

Some WCAG guidelines have to do with the content that is written.
For example, it is necessary to explain complicated words, and to explain abbreviations.
Since users can post their own content (texts, comments, images and downloads) on Argu, we cannot control this.
However, we do make sure that our own content (such as these help articles) is as accessible as possible.
