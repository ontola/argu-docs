# Group and rights management

Within your Website on Argu, you can configure who is allowed to view or edit what. This works via Groups and Permissions.

## Groups

A Group is a collection of Users in a Website. You can edit groups at Menu =&gt; Settings =&gt; Groups.

## Invite to a group

You can add people to a group in two ways:

1. Via an **email invitation**, with a unique link by mail. This is the most secure option, as it can only be used by those who actually have that email address.
2. Via a **token-link**, this can be used several times and is therefore less secure. If you use a token link to invite administrators, we recommend that you quickly remove it and make it invalid.

Read [more about how to invite works here](share.md).

## Permissions

With Permissions you can specify who is allowed to do what. Permissions are set on a Page, such as a [Forum](forums.md), and are associated with a Group. There are a few types of permissions:

1. **Read only**: only look, but don't post anything.
2. **Participate**: are allowed to respond to items (such as posting comments, or an idea under a challenge)
3. **Initiate**: start new discussions yourself
4. **Moderate**: edit and delete responses from others
5. **Maintain**: everything is allowed, including organisation settings and managing user groups
