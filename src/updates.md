# Feedback with Updates

If you want to involve people, it is valuable to keep them informed about decisions or implementation.

As administrator or owner of an item, you can click on "Update" in the top right corner of the menu. This allows you to post a message that will be shared with all the participants in the item. The update will also be visible under the item, so that it is clear to people who join later what the update is.
