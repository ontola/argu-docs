# Inviting and sharing

Invitations can be made in several ways on Argu. Each item has a "share" menu in the top right-hand corner with a number of options:

## Invite

An invite is necessary if you want to allow people to participate in **hidden content**, or if you want to give people **special rights**. This option is only visible when you are logged in. If you click on Invite, a form will open in which you can enter a list of e-mail addresses. You can also write your own explanation. Next, you have to make these people members of a group, such as "administrators" or "residents". Finally, you see a "landing page" selected; this is the item you just tried to share.

## Social media

If the item is publicly visible, a list of social media options - such as Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp and Linkedin - is displayed. These open special links that quickly go to the right app or website, where you can then share the item.

## E-Mail

This will open your mail app containing the link to the item you are trying to share.

## Copy link

This copies the link of the item to your clipboard, where you can then paste it.
You can [create QR codes here](https://nl.qr-code-generator.com/) by pasting the link.

## Voting codes

If you want to invite a group of people for an item and give them voting rights, please [contact us](mailto:info@argu.co) so we can generate a list of voting codes. In the near future this can be done directly from Argu.
