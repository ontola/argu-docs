# Create and manage surveys

On Argu you can add surveys / questionnaires. This is one of our different types of [participation tools](https://argu.co/argu/t/10578). We use the software of Typeform for this.

## Create a survey

- Create a [Typeform account](https://admin.typeform.com/signup) if you don't already have one, or [contact us](info@argu.co) to take advantage of our existing Premium account and its benefits. We will set up a Workspace for your site and can help with content.
- On Typeform, go to your project's Workspace and create a TypeForm.
- When you're done, click "publish" and copy the link in your address bar. This has the form "https://&lt;name&gt;.typeform.com/to/&lt;code&gt;".
- Create a Survey on Argu by clicking on the plus icon in the top right corner of a Forum (in a discussion thread), selecting 'new survey', filling out the form and pasting the copied link from your TypeForm there.

## Manage survey

- If you want to manage your Typeform survey from within Argu, click on the menu icon of your survey and then on 'manage'. This will take you to Typeform's website, where you can edit your survey and view the results.

## Feedback

- You can keep all participants informed of the results by clicking on the menu icon and selecting "[new update](https://argu.co/argu/t/10537)".

## Privacy

- Completed surveys do not reside on Argu's servers, but remain on TypeForm.
- TypeForm is based in Barcelona and must therefore comply with AVG / GDPR legislation.
- Users are not linked to completed surveys. We therefore do not link respondents' information to the values entered in a questionnaire. The only thing we store is that a user has completed a survey, so that they cannot complete the same survey more than once.
