# Dashboards and Widgets

Dashboards are overview pages that contain Widgets. As administrator, you can control which widgets are placed here, what they look like and in what order they are arranged. An example of a Dashboard is the [Helpdesk page](/argu/help), which contains a search widget, a new-item widget and a collection widget.

## Creating and editing widgets

Go to the dashboard settings, by clicking on the menu icon at the top right of the dashboard. Select 'Widgets' there. Press the + button there to create new ones, or select items in the table to edit or delete.

**Object**

The Object of the widget is the URL of a particular thing you want to show. This can be anything. Often [Collections](https://argu.co/argu/t/11046) are useful here.

**View**

Many widgets have three possible views:

- Preview: a very small view where usually only the title is shown.
- Compact: A compact view where the title and a drop-down text are visible.
- Full size: The full object, as if you were viewing it on its own page.

**Width**

The width is 1, 2 or 3. Three widgets fit on a row.

**Position**

The position determines the order in which the widgets are displayed.
