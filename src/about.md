Argu is an open source e-democracy and community management platform.
It's a web application that is used to help organisations to get people engaged in decision making processes.

Use it to:

- **Inform and engage** your community using a variety of [Participation Tools](e-participation_tools.md)
- **Gain insights** in what people think about something using [Votes](voting.md) and [surveys](surveys.md)
- **Structure discussions** with [Arguments](arguments.md)
- **Discuss anything** using [Forums](forums.md) and Topics
- **Gather ideas** using [Challenges](challenges_and_ideas.md)

## Getting started

If you want to set up your own Argu website, you can use one of the [paid plans on Argu.co](https://argu.co/info/prijzen) or [host it yourself for free](https://gitlab.com/ontola/argu/).
