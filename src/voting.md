# Voting on Ideas

On Argu you can vote on [Ideas](challenges_and_ideas.md). There are three default voting options:

- For
- Neutral
- Against

Everyone can vote once. A vote is only counted if the e-mail address has been confirmed.

As a user you can determine whether your votes are visible to others or not in your privacy settings.

## Custom vote actions

If you think `for`, `neutral` and `against` doesn't fit your usecase, you can create a Custom Vocabulary to set your own vote options.
