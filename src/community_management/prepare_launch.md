# 3. Launch Preparation

After all content has been placed on the Community, a plan needs to be developed for the launch.

- Invite colleagues to view your Community. Collect and process feedback.
- Check that all texts are correct and written in an accessible way.
- Go through the promotion plan once again.
- Set deadlines. This way participants can quickly see how much time they have to respond. This also creates a sense of urgency, which usually results in more interaction on your platform. You can set a deadline per item in the advanced settings.
- Check our accessibility checklist.
- Launch the Community! If it isn't public yet, go to the Community settings, and change the permissions.
