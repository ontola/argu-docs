# 2. Creating content

In this phase, the content of your community is created. The aim of your Community is to conduct a dialogue with as many people as possible from the target group in question. The online dynamic is different from a physical conversation in which you can interrupt people or quickly ask more in-depth questions. So it is even more important to ask pointed questions online.

- Start simple: make a list of the subjects you want to post on your community platform.
- Decide whether your community should be public or private.
  - An open platform offers the greatest chance of interaction because it is easy to find.
  - The chance that people who do not belong to the target group will participate is very small.
  - If you want to be sure that the participants belong to the target group, you can keep your community closed. You can invite people via e-mail, an invitation link or via a unique voting code. Read more about the different ways to [share items and invite people](../share.md).
  - The visibility of your community can be set on two different levels: on group level and on forum level. More about these settings can be found in the helpdesk article: [Group and rights management](../groups.md)
- Decide whether there are one or more themes you want to submit. It may be useful to create a separate page for each theme in your community platform. This way, you keep a visual separation between the themes.

- To create a new page, you can click on "Add page" → New forum in the menu bar. A second way is to go in the menu bar to settings → components → the plus sign in the top right corner → New forum.
- Now you need to decide what interaction you want to have with the participants.
  - Do you want to collect quantitative information? Then create a [survey](https://argu.co/academy/online-participatie/participatie-instrumenten/enquete).

In this article we give tips on how to set up a good survey.
  - Do you want to collect good ideas or let people vote and respond to different scenarios? Then create a [Challenge](../challenges_and_ideas.md).
  - Read: [step-by-step plan for formulating a good participation issue (challenge)](https://argu.co/argu/posts/11007) for good and bad examples.

## Promotion plan

Once your community has been set up, you should think about promoting the online process. A well-designed platform is no guarantee that it will be used by the target group. For that you will have to invite people.

There are, of course, the well-known communication channels that you can use:

- Letter with invitation
- Possibly a letter with voting code if you want to organise a private voting round. Contact Argu for this (mailto:info@argu.co).
- Ask neighbourhood organisations if they can invite their supporters via e-mail or WhatsApp.
- Social media messages
- Social media ads
- Posters in the neighbourhood
- Flyers in the neighbourhood
- Article in local media
- Link on the website of the municipality
- Playful actions
