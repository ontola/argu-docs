# 1. Setting up your Community

In the first phase, the Community is created by an Argu project manager.
The project manager of your Community receives an invitation link. When you open the link, you are asked to create an Argu account if you have not already done so. Your Argu account is personal and you can use your own first and last name. You are then given management rights to your Community.

With management rights, you can modify and/or delete all content, you can view usage statistics and you can grant management rights to other colleagues.

## Actions and tips:

- Share the invitation link with your involved colleagues. You can invite an unlimited number of administrators.
- Find good images for the logo of your Community, the cover photo of the website and as background for all the content you want to place on the platform.
  - Preferably choose large, high-resolution photos with no text in the image. The website is responsive and therefore scales to the screen size of the user. If there is text in the image, there is a good chance that it will not be aligned properly.
  - Please note that most photos are protected by copyright. So choose photos from your Community's image bank or use Creative Commons images from the internet. For example, via [Pexels.com](http://Pexels.com) or [Google Images where you filter on royalty-free photos](https://www.google.com/search?q=zoek&tbm=isch&hl=nl&tbs=il:cl&sa=X&ved=0CAAQ1vwEahcKEwjw7eCczJbuAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAw&biw=2545&bih=1361).
