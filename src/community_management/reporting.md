# 5. Reporting and Evaluation

After the start of your project, you'll want to monitor how things are going with the number of visitors, users and reactions on your Community.

## During the project

- **View the reactions** on the Community in chronological order via the `activity` button.
- Keep track of the **statistics** to see how engagement is going. These can be accessed only as Admins.
- **Ask for an interim report** from your Argu project manager and receive visitor and user statistics for your Community.
- Review the statistics and determine if you want to invest additional time and resources in engaging the target audience.
- **Incorporate any feedback from participants** on the Community. For example, make texts clearer or add supporting visuals. You can also add frequently asked questions to the text.

## After the project

- Link back with [Updates](../updates.md) so participants know what happened to their input.
