# E-participation community management

A _community engagement project_ is a project with a clear time schedule in which a certain target group is involved in one or more subjects.
In this section, we'll teach you everything you need to know about planning and implementing a successful project. Our knowledge and experience with more than 150 online participation projects is bundled here.

## What does an online participation process usually look like?

In the following chapters we describe all steps that are taken in most online participation processes.

1. [Setting up the platform](setup.md). In this phase, the platform is created, colleagues are invited as administrators and it is ensured that the platform fits the corporate identity of your organisation.
2. [Developing content](content.md). Now that the issue is clear, the website is set up. This way, everyone gets a feeling of what it will eventually look like.
3. [Preparing the launch](prepare_launch.md). We discuss the first version and adjust a few things where necessary. All with the aim of increasing involvement.
4. [Starting the project](start_project.md). The website is ready to go live and connect with your community. Now it's a matter of generating visitors. We advise you on this.
5. [Reporting and evaluating](reporting.md). Just like you, we are curious about the success of the project. We evaluate the course of events together and look at the level of involvement during the project.
