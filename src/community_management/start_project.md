# 4. Launching the Project

Now that the track has been launched, people will start using your Community. The goal is to gather input from as many people as possible. In addition to promotional actions to drive people to the Community, there are a number of things you can do during the trajectory to encourage interaction on the Community.

- Actively respond to content
  - Thank participants and give compliments for good contributions.
  - Ask for ideas and comments from participants.
  - Answer questions from participants or connect them with colleagues who can answer their questions.
- Mid-term evaluation
  - Request an interim report from Argu
  - Review the statistics and determine if you want to invest additional time and resources in engaging the target audience.
  - Incorporate any feedback from participants on the Community. For example, make texts clearer or add supporting visuals. You can also add frequently asked questions to the text.
- Keep promoting. After the launch, part of the target group will visit and use the Community. But people who have not yet participated will soon forget that you invited them.
  - Send a reminder of the invitation.
  - Also use other communication channels to direct people to the Community.

## During the process

- Actively respond to content. Make use of our tips regarding moderation policies (part of the guide "What to do during the trajectory?").
- Do a mid-term evaluation.
  - What percentage of the target audience is now participating?
  - What percentage of the invitees are now participating? This should be about 10%.
