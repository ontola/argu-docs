# Search

All items you can view on Argu are searchable. You probably already found the Search button in the navigation bar, but did you know you can also search _within_ an item? Click the item menu (the three dots at the top right of an item) and click Search. This is very useful to find a message in a specific forum or discussion!

You can also **filter** and **sort** the search results by clicking on the icons at the top right of a search page.
