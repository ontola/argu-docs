# Adding images to text

When creating an item, you can easily add a cover photo and [add attachments](attachments.md). A cover photo appears at the top of the page, as a sort of background, and the attachments appear as icons under the item you have created.

If you want to add an image _inside_ a text, things are a bit more complicated:

1. Upload an image from the Internet. This can be as an attachment to your item, or from another website such as [imgur](https://imgur.com/upload). This can also be as an [attachment in Argu](attachments.md).
2. In a text field where you want to add the image, add the following text: `![description](https://example.com/linknaarjeplaatje)`.
3. Change the URL to your image, and change the text to a description for the visually impaired.

For example, `[argu logo](https://argu-logos.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/827/box_Argu_Logo_2.0_matched_5_.jpg)` will become:

![argu logo](https://argu-logos.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/827/box_Argu_Logo_2.0_matched_5_.jpg)
