# What are "Items"?

An _Item_ is a thing that someone has created, such as a Topic, a Comment, an [Idea](https://argu.co/argu/t/10538) or a [Forum](https://argu.co/argu/t/10580). Items have a number of properties that often recur:

- They are somewhere in a tree hierarchy, so Items are somewhere _below_. You can see what the parent items are in the _breadcrumbs_, which are the little buttons right below the navigation bar. Here, for example, the _Helpdesk_ is the parent item.
- You can [follow] items (https://argu.co/argu/t/10803) and receive notifications from them. By setting notifications to "always", you will receive notifications for every new, directly underlying Item.
- Administrators can export Items (https://argu.co/argu/t/10808).
- You can [search] through Items (https://argu.co/argu/t/10889).
- You can edit Items (as administrator or owner).
- In addition, most Items have the option of attaching [attachments](https://argu.co/argu/t/10793) or [locations](https://argu.co/argu/t/10921).
