# Forums

A Forum is a (discussion) environment where people can post items. This Helpdesk is an example of a Forum. As administrator, you can [set permissions](groups.md) on who can view, edit, and post items in a Forum.

A Forum can contain different types of discussions. Read more about what kind of [tools](e-participation_tools.md) are available.

The display of a forum is a [Dashboard](dashboards_and_widgets.md), which contains [Widgets](dashboards_and_widgets.md). These can be changed.
