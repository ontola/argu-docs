# Forums

A Forum is a (discussion) environment where people can post items. This Helpdesk is an example of a Forum. As administrator, you can [set permissions](https://argu.co/argu/t/10536) on who can view, edit, and post items in a Forum.

A Forum can contain different types of discussions. Read more about what kind of [tools](e-participation_tools.md) are available.

The display of a forum is a [Dashboard](https://argu.co/argu/t/10948), which contains [Widgets](https://argu.co/argu/t/10948). These can be changed.
