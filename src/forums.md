# Forums

A Forum is a (discussion) environment where people can post items.

A Forum can contain different types of discussions.
Read more about what kind of [tools](e-participation_tools.md) are available.

The display of a forum is a [Dashboard](dashboards_and_widgets.md), which contains [Widgets](dashboards_and_widgets.md). These can be changed.


By default, every Community has _one_ forum.
You can create more and give custom rights, e.g. have one forum only for Admins.

As administrator, you can [set permissions](groups.md) on who can view, edit, and post items in a Forum.
