# Delete account

You can delete your account by going to your privacy settings: click on your profile picture at the top right of the screen, and go to 'settings', and then 'privacy'. There you can delete your account.

Once you have done this, your profile and personal data will be removed from our servers. The items (such as your comments) that you have posted will still be on the website, but no longer under your name. We do this to prevent gaps in discussions. Would you still like your posted reactions to disappear from the website? Please let us know by sending an e-mail to support@argu.co.
